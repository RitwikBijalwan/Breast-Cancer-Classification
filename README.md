# Breast-Cancer-Classification
The project is done as a case study of Breast Cancer Classification with implementation of Support Vector Machine.
Dataset used for the purpose is in-built dataset provided by sklearn.


## Support Vector Machine->
Support Vector Machine or SVM, is one of those ML algorithms that make its use for classification as well as for regression. But most widespread use of SVM is for classification purpose.

SVM makes use of hyperplanes to separate two classes. It can be in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D or higher dimension.
For 1-D data, a point can be used as a hyperplane to separate two classes.
For 2-D data, a line can be used as a hyperplane for class separation.
For 3-D data, a plane can be used as a hyperplane for class separation.
Usually for 3-D or above higher dimensional data, hyperplane is most used term for class separation space.


SVM makes classification based on hyperplane and margins.
It is required that there is better classification done when the distance between hyperplane and margin is as large as possible. But priority is given to better prediction accuracy over the equation of hyperplane that best possibly separates the classes.

Hyperparameter tuning can be done to adjust the model parameters to such value that can give us better results.

Also, it is to be noted that accuracy is not the only metric that we should rely on because sometimes there may be cases of class imbalance which gives prediction due to majority classes at the expense of minority classes. Hence, we should also consider other metrics like precision, recall or sensitivity, specificity, f1 score,etc.
